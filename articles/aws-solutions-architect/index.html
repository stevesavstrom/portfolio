		<p>Preparing for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam? I passed the exam recently and want to share a few helpful resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jon Bonso&#39;s AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams (Tutorials Dojo/Udemy): These are absolutely essential and I would not have passed without them. High quality questions that are updated frequently with great explanations.
</li>
<li>StÃ©phane Maarek&#39;s Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2022 (Udemy): Great overview of core AWS services and hands on tutorials. This course is valuable beyond the exam and I will definitely be revisiting the tutorials.
</li>
<li>Keenan Romain&#39;s AWS-SAA-C02-Study Guide (GitHub): This excellent free guide is concise and well aligned to the concepts assessed on the exam. I spent a lot of time on this guide the last two weeks before the exam. This guide also pointed me to other helpful resources mentioned here.
</li>
<li>Andrew Brown&#39;s AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2020 (freeCodeCamp/ExamPro): Another amazing free resource that is available on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. The cheat sheets for each section are very helpful (check the comments for timestamps).
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Strategy:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam first to ensure a solid foundation in AWS services and concepts. (6 months out)</li>
<li>Get hands on experience in the AWS management console building small applications and configuring services. (3 months out)</li>
<li>Take practice exams, review incorrect answers and explanations, re-take until achieving 95%+. (1 month out)</li>
<li>Save one or two practice exams until the week of the exam and use them to simulate a real exam. (1 week out)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the exam was challenging and required deep knowledge of core services along with an ability to design and implement distributed systems on AWS. I am excited to take this next step in my AWS journey and I am looking forward applying these skills in my current role.</p>
