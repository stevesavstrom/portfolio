		<p>As a new software engineer I wanted to develop my cloud computing skills so that I had the ability to build and deploy modern web applications that were scalable, highly-available, and performant. As new engineer at a large company, I saw that there were many legacy applications that needed to be migrated to or rebuilt in the cloud.</p>
<p>I took my first step into cloud computing by taking the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">AWS Cloud Practitioner exam</a>. The exam covers a wide range of topics, including different AWS services, security, architecture, pricing, and support. I want to share my experience and how I prepared for the exam.</p>
<p>The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam assesses foundational skills in Amazon Web Services (AWS) with an emphasis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of cloud computing</li>
<li>AWS shared responsibility model</li>
<li>AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices</li>
<li>Security best practices, </li>
<li>Core AWS services including compute, network, databases, and storage</li>
<li>Identifying AWS services for common use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam covers the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Concepts (26% of exam):</strong>This domain covers basic cloud computing concepts, including the characteristics of cloud computing, the benefits of using the cloud, and the differences between different deployment models (e.g., public, private, and hybrid cloud).
</li>
<li><strong>Security and Compliance (25% of exam):</strong> This domain covers the security features and best practices for the AWS Cloud, including the AWS shared responsibility model, identity and access management, and data encryption.
</li>
<li><strong>Technology (33% of exam):</strong> This domain covers the key AWS services and features, including compute, storage, database, and network services. It also covers the AWS global infrastructure, including regions and availability zones.
</li>
<li><strong>Billing and Pricing (16% of exam):</strong> This domain covers the pricing models for AWS services and the tools and features available for managing and optimizing costs.
Support: This domain covers the AWS support plans and the resources available for troubleshooting and getting help with AWS.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I studied for 3 weeks and spent about 20 hours on video courses, documentation, tutorials, and practice exams. I found these resources the most useful:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/">AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/">Udemy AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exams HQ Questions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-amazon/">Udemy AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exams</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a multiple-choice and multiple-response exam, which means that it consists of questions that have one or more correct answers. The exam is delivered through a network of testing centers around the world, and it is administered using a computer-based testing (CBT) system. The exam consists of 65 questions, and individuals have 90 minutes to complete it. To pass the exam, individuals must score at least 720 out of 1000 points.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#39;m happy that I chose to get certified! I'm excited to apply the skills in my current role and I'm motivated to keep learning and earning more certifications in the future.</p>
