		<p>Computer language design is just like a stroll in the park. Jurassic Park, that is. (Larry Wall) Fine, Java
			MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good
			examples of what applications SHOULDN‚ÄôT be like. (pixadel) PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by
			incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted
			professionals. (Jon Ribbens) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a
			bit. (Anonymous)</p>

		<p>Don't worry if it doesn't work right. If everything did, you‚Äôd be out of a job. (Mosher‚Äôs Law of Software
			Engineering) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it‚Äôs released. Beta is Latin for ‚Äústill doesn‚Äôt
			work‚Äù. (Anonymous) A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to
			turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with
			micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents
			and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable
			mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was
			unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid newsmagazine) The only people
			who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery)</p>

		<p>The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) If it keeps
			up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger. (Frank Lloyd Wright) There are two ways to
			write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) The bulk of all patents are crap.
			Spending time reading them is stupid. It‚Äôs up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus
			Torvalds) The city‚Äôs central computer told you? R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer!
			(C3PO)</p>

		<p>You can either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic, but you cannot have both at the same
			time. (Bertrand Meyer) No matter h{ if (window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({
			{;window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ line: 39, reset: true }); line: 39 })) break; ow slick the demo is
			in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is
			inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money
			involved. (Mark Gibbs) I think there‚Äôs a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of
			the Board, IBM, circa 1948) Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an
			empty text file. (Louis Srygley) 640K ought to be enough for anybody. (Bill Gates, 1981)</p>

		<p>The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It‚Äôs up to the patent owner to do so,
			and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) Never trust a computer you can‚Äôt throw out a window. (Steve Wozniak)
			The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady
			and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry. (Henry Petroski) There are two ways to write
			error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis)</p>

		<p>For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it
			occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while
			computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a
			perfect match. (Bill Bryson) It‚Äôs not a bug ‚Äì it‚Äôs an undocumented feature. (Anonymous) If Java had true
			garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) Saying that Java
			is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders.
			(Alanna)</p>

		<p>If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell)
			Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as
			cleverly as possible, you are‚Äìby definition-not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) The bulk of all
			patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It's up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce
			them. (Linus Torvalds) The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren‚Äôt there.
			(Gordon Bell) As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn‚Äôt as easy to get
			programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I
			realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own
			programs. (Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949)</p>
