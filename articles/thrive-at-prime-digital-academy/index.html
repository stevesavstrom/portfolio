		<h2 class="post-subtitle">10 Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Prime Experience</h2>
		<p class="date">STEVE SAVSTROM / published 27 SEPTEMBER 2021</p>
		<hr>
		<p>This year, I made the leap from teaching to tech and completed the full stack software engineering program at
			Prime Digital Academy. Over the course of 20 weeks, I transformed my software engineering skills from
			writing my first ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program to building full stack applications with React, Node.js, Express,
			and PostgreSQL. I learned so much along the way and want to share some tips with future Primers. Here is my
			advice for getting the most out of your experience:</p>

		<h2>Build a Community</h2>

		<p>Success at Prime is largely dependent on the strength of your relationships with others in your cohort. You
			are not on this journey alone and you will be far more successful if you connect and collaborate with your
			classmates as much as possible.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Challenge yourself to meet everyone in your cohort during Tier 1. Reach out on Slack
			or meet up on
			Zoom. Build connections, learn about everyone's background and their career aspirations. You will be working
			closely with each of them over the next few months.</p>

		<h2>Immerse Yourself</h2>

		<p>Prime is more than a full time job for 20 weeks (expect 60+ hour weeks.) Design your lifestyle so that Prime
			can be your top priority. Communicate with your partner, family, and friends about the commitment and talk
			about creating a healthy schedule so that you can focus on your code and also fulfill other
			responsibilities.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Share your calendar and schedule with important people in your life so that you are
			all on the same page. Mark important dates such as your solo and group project presentations.</p>

		<h2>Be Present</h2>

		<p>Prime moves fast and every moment counts. Each piece of the curriculum is created to give you the
			foundational skills you need to be a successful software engineer. Show up to every lecture, career session,
			industry speaker, mentor meeting, and study group. Be a sponge and soak up as much as you can.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Take breaks between sessions to clear your head and allow yourself to move on to
			what's next. You may want to keep working on a problem or bug from the previous lecture but try to
			compartmentalize so that you can be fully present in the next session. Take time at the end of the day to
			circle back and reflect on questions that need more attention.</p>

		<h2>Be Your Authentic Self </h2>

		<p>Every Prime student is making a career change. Remember that you are an asset to your
			cohort and the Prime community. Bring your unique background and experience to your cohort. Offer your
			perspective, strengths, and experience throughout the program.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Reflect on the skills you are bringing with you to Prime and find ways to utilize
			them. Technical, creative, and leadership skills will all be useful throughout Prime as you tackle projects. Having elf-awareness of your unique strengths is also helpful for crafting your resume, cover letters, and your personal narrative heading into your job search. Share Your Code</p>

		<p>Don't be afraid to show what you're working on. Make your GitHub repositories public, participate in code
			reviews with your peers, share your code and ask for help debugging. Live debugging during class can be
			incredibly helpful to you and your whole cohort.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Pair programming is a great way to build confidence coding and communicating. Make time to pair program with others in your cohort.</p>

		<h2>Document Your Process</h2>

		<p>Make a habit of taking notes, writing descriptive and thorough code comments, posting on LinkedIn, and
			sharing resources on Slack.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Writing high-quality code comments is essential for being able to revisit and learn from your previous work. You will be referring to old projects constantly and, without descriptive comments, it can be easy to get lost in your own code.</p>

		<h2>Be Vulnerable and Ask Questions (Constantly)</h2>

		<p>Every concept taught at Prime is essential and it is important that you are constantly clarifying your
			understanding and getting feedback. Questions allow your instructors to reinforce concepts that haven‚Äôt been
			mastered. If you have a question, others likely do too and it helps everyone if you ask.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Write your questions down and bring them to class. Be prepared to talk about what you tried already and what didn't work. Have your own code ready to share as an example.</p>

		<h2>Embrace Collaboration</h2>

		<p>One of the most important skills you will develop at Prime is the ability to collaborate with diverse teams
			to build projects. Each week you will be shuffled into new groups and presented with a new problem to solve.
			Practice navigating this collaborative process and pay attention to how you are growing along the way.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> When starting a new group project, establish team norms and a clear vision for what you want to accomplish. Find consensus for what your goal is and the tools and strategies you will use to achieve it. Document these norms and revisit them throughout the project.</p>

		<h2>Avoid Comparing Yourself to Others</h2>

		<p>Remember that everyone's background and experience is different. Establish your own goals and measure your
			individual progress toward those goals. Your coding journey is not linear and there are many "right" ways to
			do things. Imposter syndrome will creep in at times but it is a distraction from continuing to invest in
			your personal growth.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Revisit your old code and compare your current self to where you were a week ago or a month ago. That's the only comparison that matters. Recognize how far you have come and believe that progress will continue.</p>

		<p>Start Your Job Search Early and Build Your Network</p>

		<p>It is never too early to polish your resume, draft cover letters, and start applying for jobs. Most Prime
			students start applying for jobs during Tier 2 but resumes and other materials can be done even earlier.
			Networking can start immediately and Prime provides a lot of opportunities to connect with alumni through
			career speakers and mentor groups.</p>

		<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Listen to Christy! Each week you will have 1-2 hours of career development time with Christy Larsen, Prime's Director of Employer Partnerships. She will provide a roadmap for navigating the application process and getting a job. This includes writing resumes, cover letters, interviewing, networking, applying, and following up on applications. Christy has helped hundreds of new software engineers land their first job, so pay attention and implement her strategies.</p>

		<p>Hopefully these tips are helpful as you start your coding journey! Prime was a transformational experience
			for me as I moved from teaching to tech. These practices helped me succeed and get the most out of the
			program. You are making a great choice by joining this community and I wish you all the best!</p>
