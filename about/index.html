		<h1><a href="/about/index.html">Hi, I'm Steve! ðŸ‘‹</a></h1>

		<p>
			I'm a full stack software engineer with experience creating web applications using JavaScript, React,
			Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, and other modern technologies. I am currently a Full Stack Software
			Engineering Student at Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis. At Prime, I built, Flash Gig, an application
			that helps wedding photographers and videographers connect with second shooters, editors, and assistants for
			short-term gigs. Flash Gig was created using React, Redux, Saga, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Material-UI.,
			and Google Maps API.

			I'm a teacher at heart. After graduating from Augsburg University in 2008, I moved to Seoul, South Korea where I taught English from 2009-2012. After returning to the United States, I moved to Chicago as a 2013
			Teach For America corps member. During my Teach For America experience I taught middle school and completed
			a master's degree in Special Education at National Louis University. In 2015, I returned home to Minnesota
			and joined Roosevelt High School as a special education resource teacher and case manager. In 2018, I
			founded Savstrom Studios, a wedding videography company. In 2021 I started my coding journey and joined
			Prime Digital Academy as a Full Stack Software Engineering student.
